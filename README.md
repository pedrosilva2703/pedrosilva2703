### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm 23 years old and recently graduated from the Electrical and Computer Engineering master's programme at FEUP. During my studies, I had the opportunity to develop my programming skills, teamwork abilities and problem solving by actively participating in academic projects, creating applications for automation, computer vision and robotics.
